        <h2>Naija Yellow Catalogue, bridging the gap between business owners and consumers online.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Naija Yellow Catalogue is an online business directory that contains the necessary information
          about
          businesses that
          are registered on the platform. The Naija Yellow Catalogue enables business owners to easily
          showcase
          their business and
          also aids the consumers to easily find useful information on required services.
          Naija Yellow Catalogue took shape after we carried out critical research on the increasing number of
          businesses
          especially the number of entrepreneurs over the years. Little businesses and start-ups have little
          or no
          online
          documentation. This makes it hard to find and patronize such businesses.
          Naija Yellow Catalogue has provided a scalable catalogue that solves the aforementioned issues ,
          assures
          satisfaction
          and comfort, all at ease. We have also included an outstanding feature “EVENT TAB” which helps to
          search
          happening
          events around your location.
